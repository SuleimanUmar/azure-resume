This project was created as part of the Azure Resume Challenge, a learning opportunity for individuals to gain practical experience with Azure cloud technologies while building a project that showcases their skills.

# Overview
For this project, I built a web page to showcase my professional skills and experience. The page includes a brief introduction about myself, my skills, and work experience. Additionally, the page displays a live counter of how many times the page has been visited.

# Technologies Used
To build this project, I used the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS: for the structure and styling of the web page.
- JavaScript: to handle the functionality of the live counter and API calls.
- Azure Functions: to host the API used for the live counter.
- Azure DevOps: for version control and CI/CD pipeline management.

# How to Use
To use this project, you can simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. The live counter will automatically update each time the page is visited.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Microsoft for providing the Azure Resume Challenge as an opportunity to gain practical experience with Azure cloud technologies. Additionally, I would like to thank the open source community for providing resources and support throughout the development of this project.
